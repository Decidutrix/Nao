Say hi to Nao
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Coming directly from the Soul Stream, Nao is a bot I developed in python for my guild Discord server called Azorius.
Nao has an array of features that is useful for our server such as :

The usual Discord bot duties

### Welcome and Leave messages
Nao is able to see everyone who enters and leaves the guild discord and prompts a message accordingly.

### Role Assignment
Every Discord bot is able to assign roles through reactions so because I wanted a more personalized bot and didn't
want to pay a premuim I decided that I'd add that to Nao as well and thanks to self hosting I'm able to log everyone
who recieved a role.
