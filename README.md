# Nao

Say hi to Nao
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Coming directly from the Soul Stream, Nao is a bot I developed in python for my guild Discord server called Azorius.
Nao has an array of features that is useful for our server such as :

The usual Discord bot duties

### Welcome and Leave messages
Nao is able to see everyone who enters and leaves the guild discord and prompts a message accordingly.

### Role Assignment
Every Discord bot is able to assign roles through reactions so because I wanted a more personalized bot and didn't
want to pay a premuim I decided that I'd add that to Nao as well and thanks to self hosting I'm able to log everyone
who recieved a role.

This is where the bot differs from others I've seen and used. These next few features I implemented specifically
for this server but after looking over some of the feats, I'll be adding some of them to other bots I create in the future
and tweaking them to adjust the need of that bot/server.

### Party Board System
Need a party in game? Well Nao's got ya covered, all you gotta do is just use !partyup and then list your party's name,
how many you need, and what you're doing. The party request will also be controlled through reactions as well and when
the amount needed is met, the party request will close.

### WIKI TIME
Nao is able to pull results of anything you need off of the [Mabinogi World Wiki](https://wiki.mabinogiworld.com/).
For example you need to know about Alby Dungeon then you just use !wiki Alby Dungeon and you'll get your result.
